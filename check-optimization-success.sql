-- Run this to see your performance improvements

-- 1. Check that new indexes are working
SELECT 
    '🗂️ Performance Indexes Created:' as info,
    count(*) as total_indexes
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%';

-- 2. List all new performance indexes
SELECT 
    tablename,
    indexname,
    'Created ✅' as status
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND indexname LIKE 'idx_%'
ORDER BY tablename;

-- 3. Check monitoring views are working
SELECT '📊 Performance Views Ready:' as info;

-- Test performance stats view
SELECT 
    tablename,
    CASE 
        WHEN idx_scan > seq_scan THEN '⚡ Fast (Index-optimized)'
        WHEN seq_scan > 0 THEN '🔍 Normal (Sequential scans)'
        ELSE '📭 Empty/New table'
    END as performance_status
FROM v_performance_stats 
WHERE tablename IN ('products', 'orders', 'clinics', 'categories')
LIMIT 10;

-- 4. Database size info
SELECT '💾 Database Status:' as info;
SELECT * FROM v_database_size;
