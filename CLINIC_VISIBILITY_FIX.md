# üîß Clinic Visibility Issue - Complete Solution Guide

## Problem Summary

Clinics created by limited-permission users (like "mo") disappear after page refresh and are not visible to either the creating user or admin users.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stems from **three interconnected problems**:

1. **RLS (Row Level Security) Policies**: The clinics table may have restrictive RLS policies that prevent users from seeing clinics they've created
2. **Caching Layer**: The frontend caches clinic data for 2 minutes, which may cache empty results
3. **Service Role Key Usage**: The API route should use service_role key to bypass RLS, but might be falling back to anon key

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Run Diagnostic Tests

1. **Check API Diagnostic Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   # Open this URL in your browser while logged in
   http://localhost:3000/api/clinics/debug
   ```
   
   This will show you:
   - Whether service role key is present
   - How many clinics exist in the database
   - Current authenticated user
   - Specific recommendations

2. **Run SQL Diagnostic Script**:
   - Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `diagnose_clinics_rls.sql`
   - Run each query section by section to understand:
     - Current RLS status
     - Existing RLS policies
     - Total clinics count
     - Clinics with NULL area/line

### Step 2: Fix RLS Policies

Based on your diagnostic results, you have **two options**:

#### Option A: Temporarily Disable RLS (Quick Fix - Development Only)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Only use this in development!
ALTER TABLE clinics DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Pros**: Immediate fix, all users can see all clinics
**Cons**: No security, not suitable for production

#### Option B: Implement Proper RLS Policies (Recommended)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE clinics ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop any existing conflicting policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role has full access" ON clinics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can read all clinics" ON clinics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can insert clinics" ON clinics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their registered clinics" ON clinics;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins and managers can delete clinics" ON clinics;

-- Policy 1: Service role bypasses all RLS (for API routes)
CREATE POLICY "Service role has full access" 
ON clinics 
FOR ALL 
TO service_role 
USING (true) 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Policy 2: All authenticated users can read all clinics
-- (The frontend will handle role-based filtering)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can read all clinics" 
ON clinics 
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated 
USING (true);

-- Policy 3: All authenticated users can insert clinics
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert clinics" 
ON clinics 
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated 
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Policy 4: Users can update clinics they registered, or admins/managers can update any
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their registered clinics" 
ON clinics 
FOR UPDATE 
TO authenticated 
USING (
    registered_by = auth.uid() 
    OR EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM users 
        WHERE users.id = auth.uid() 
        AND users.role IN ('admin', 'gm', 'manager')
    )
)
WITH CHECK (
    registered_by = auth.uid() 
    OR EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM users 
        WHERE users.id = auth.uid() 
        AND users.role IN ('admin', 'gm', 'manager')
    )
);

-- Policy 5: Only admins and managers can delete clinics
CREATE POLICY "Admins and managers can delete clinics" 
ON clinics 
FOR DELETE 
TO authenticated 
USING (
    EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM users 
        WHERE users.id = auth.uid() 
        AND users.role IN ('admin', 'gm', 'manager')
    )
);
```

### Step 3: Verify Service Role Key

Ensure your `.env.local` file has the service role key:

```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key-here"
```

**Important**: After adding or modifying `.env.local`, you MUST restart your development server:

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
# Then restart it
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Clear Cache

After applying the fixes:

1. **Clear Frontend Cache**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage tab
   - Clear all storage (or just localStorage/sessionStorage)
   - Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)

2. **Clear Server Cache** (if using):
   - Restart your development server
   - The in-memory cache will be cleared automatically

### Step 5: Test the Fix

1. **Login as "mo" user** (limited permissions)
2. **Create a new clinic** with all required fields (name, doctor name, area, line)
3. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or F5)
4. **Verify the clinic is visible** in the list
5. **Logout and login as "admin"**
6. **Verify the clinic is visible** to admin as well

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Browser Console Logs

When the clinics page loads, you should see:

```
‚úÖ Fetched X clinics via API
```

If you see `0 clinics`, there's still an issue.

### Check Network Tab

1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Filter by "clinics"
3. Refresh the page
4. Click on the `/api/clinics` request
5. Check the Response tab - you should see an array of clinic objects

### Check Server Logs

In your terminal where the dev server is running, look for:

```
üîë Using service_role key for clinic creation
üìù Clinic will be registered by user: [user-id]
‚úÖ Clinic created successfully: [clinic-data]
```

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ‚úÖ User "mo" can create clinics
2. ‚úÖ User "mo" can see their created clinics after refresh
3. ‚úÖ Admin can see all clinics including those created by "mo"
4. ‚úÖ Non-admin users see only clinics in their area/line (filtered by frontend)
5. ‚úÖ No clinics "disappear" after page refresh

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting to restart dev server** after modifying `.env.local`
2. **Browser caching old data** - always hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **RLS policies conflicting** - drop old policies before creating new ones
4. **NULL area or line values** - ensure all clinics have valid area and line set
5. **Session expired** - logout and login again if you've been working for a long time

## üÜò Still Not Working?

If clinics still disappear after following all steps:

1. Run the debug endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/clinics/debug`
2. Run the SQL diagnostic script
3. Check both browser console and server terminal logs
4. Share the output from the debug endpoint and any error messages
